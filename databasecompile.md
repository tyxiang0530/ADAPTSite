# Database Compilation

A key component of ADAPT is a continually
updated database of physicists and their demographic information, including binary gender, race or ethnicity, and birthplace. The database was initially constructed by
scraping information from websites of notable physicists, and is continuously updated by ADAPT as new names are identified in examined textbooks. The database is periodically checked by hand for accuracy. 

To initially construct the database, we compile lists of physicists and scientists from aggregator sites such as [the Wikipedia list of physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physicists). We place all of these into a txt file and then begin querying each names Wikipedia entry (if it exists) from the Wikimedia API. With the WikiMedia API, we can scrape the scientists name, birth country, birth city, race, gender. Sometimes, these fields are not available, but simply having a name in the database allows for faster and more accurate name detection from texts.

Our final compiled physicist database is an extensive list of around 3000 unique dictionaries containing the following information: The name of the person, the name returned when wikipedia is queried, whether the person is a human, the gender of the person, the birth city of the person, the birth country of the person, the race of the person, a 'MatchName' variable that is used for matching in the name grabbing phase, a 'FullName' variable that is used for checking in the wikipedia querying phase, the race of the person according to Wikipedia, the race of the person conducted through hand-tagging and a 'MatchingNames' variable that is leftover for sanity checking purposes. 

We manually supplement the race of the queried entry through hand-tagging. This hand-tagging is done through phenotypic observation by two researchers independently. Only races that have agreement from both taggers are retained.

A sample entry in the database looks like the following:

| Name            | Wiki Name       | Human | Sex  | Birth Location  | Birth Country  | Race      | MatchName | FullName        | Wiki Race  | Matching Names |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------|------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| Michael Faraday | Michael_Faraday | human | male | Newington Butts | United Kingdom | caucasian | FARADAY   | MICHAEL FARADAY |            |                |


The 'MatchName' variable is used for name matching. It contains only the last name of the physicist in the entry. We match last names instead of full names as we are iterating over tokens. This conveniently is also helpful to minimize the effect of OCR error, abbreviations, and odd formatting, as the simplicity reduces the chance of words being OCRed wrong.
